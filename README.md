Movie Explorer is a dynamic web application built using React that allows users to discover, search, and manage their favorite movies.

Key Features:
- Home Page: Displays a curated list of popular movies fetched through API calls.

- Search Functionality: Users can search for movies by title using live data from an external movie API.

- Favorites System: Each movie card includes a button that lets users add or remove the movie from their favorites list.

- Persistent Favorites: Favorite movies are saved to localStorage, so they remain even after the user refreshes or closes the browser.

- API Integration: Fetches up-to-date movie details including posters, titles, and release years.

- Clean UI: Simple and responsive design with interactive movie cards and overlays.

Tech Stack:
- React (Functional Components, Hooks, Context API)
